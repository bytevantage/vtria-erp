# VTRIA ERP - Production Ready System Documentation

## ✅ System Overview

Your VTRIA ERP system is now **production-ready** with comprehensive product lifecycle management that addresses all your requirements.

## 🎯 Key Requirements Addressed

### ✅ 1. Database Storage (Not Hardcoded)
- **All data stored in MySQL database**
- **No hardcoded values in the application**

- **Same products from different vendors with varying prices**
- **Date-based pricing validity**
- **Automatic best price selection during estimation**
- **Complete pricing history tracking**

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Product Tracking
**Core Fields:**
- Name, Make, Model, Product Code, Category, Subcategory
- Unit (Kgs, Liters, Numbers), MRP, Vendor Discount
- HSN Code, GST Rate, Last Purchase Price
- Serial Number Requirements, Warranty Period (Months/Years)

**Business Logic:**
- Stock Management (Min/Max/Reorder levels)

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Enhanced Tables
```sql
products (20+ fields)
├── Basic Info: name, make, model, product_code, part_code
├── Classification: category_id, sub_category_id, unit, hsn_code
├── Pricing: mrp, vendor_discount, gst_rate, last_purchase_price
├── Stock: min_stock_level, max_stock_level, reorder_level
└── Tracking: serial_number_required, warranty_period, warranty_period_type

vendor_prices
├── product_id, vendor_name, vendor_price, vendor_discount
├── final_price (calculated), valid_from, valid_until
└── Automatic best price selection

estimation_sections
├── estimation_id, section_name, section_order
└── Predefined: Main Panel, Generator, UPS, Incoming, Outgoing

stock
├── product_id, location_id, quantity
└── Real-time stock status calculation
```

### Product Categories Structure
```
✅ Technical Categories (Products):
├── Electrical
│   ├── Circuit Breakers (MCBs, MCCBs)
│   └── Other electrical components
├── Control Panels
│   └── Distribution Boards
├── Generators
├── UPS Systems
└── Other technical categories

❌ Removed Operational Categories:
├── Incoming (estimation-only)
└── Outgoing (estimation-only)
```

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Products Management
```
GET /api/products - Enhanced with best vendor pricing
GET /api/products/:id - Individual product details
POST /api/products - Create new product
PUT /api/products/:id - Update product
GET /api/products/low-stock - Products below reorder levels
GET /api/products/serial-required - Products requiring serial tracking
GET /api/products/:id/vendor-prices - All vendor prices for product
```

### Vendor Pricing
```
Best Price Selection Algorithm:
1. Filter active vendor prices
2. Check validity dates (valid_from <= today <= valid_until)
3. Calculate final_price = vendor_price * (1 - vendor_discount/100)
4. Select minimum final_price
5. Return best vendor details
```
