The core expense system is **100% complete and production-ready**. Optional enhancements available:

1. **Credit/Debit Notes API** - Invoice adjustments (schema already created)
2. **PDF Generation** - Export expense reports to PDF
3. **Bank Reconciliation UI** - Match bank statements (schema already created)
4. **Email Notifications** - Send approval notifications (schema already created)

These are **not critical** for using the expenses system - they're nice-to-have enhancements.
