# 🔧 Leave Management - Self-Service Leave Application Fix

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issue**: Employee dropdown blank + Wrong UX design  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

### User Feedback:
> "Apply for Leave - Employee dropdown is blank. But I feel only the person who logged in can apply for leave for himself."

### Issues Found:
1. **Security/UX Issue**: System allowed selecting ANY employee for leave application
2. **Design Flaw**: HR/Admin perspective vs Employee self-service perspective
3. **API Error**: Employee dropdown fetch failing with authentication error
4. **Blank Dropdown**: Even if it worked, showing all employees is wrong

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changed From: Multi-Employee Selection
```typescript
<FormControl fullWidth required>
  <InputLabel>Employee *</InputLabel>
  <Select
    value={formData.employee_id}
    label="Employee *"
    onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, employee_id: e.target.value })}
  >
    {employees.map((emp) => (
      <MenuItem key={emp.id} value={emp.id.toString()}>
        {emp.first_name} {emp.last_name} ({emp.employee_id})
      </MenuItem>
    ))}
  </Select>
</FormControl>
```

### Changed To: Self-Service (Logged-in User Only)
```typescript
<TextField
  fullWidth
  label="Employee"
  value={currentEmployee ? `${currentEmployee.first_name} ${currentEmployee.last_name} (${currentEmployee.employee_id})` : 'Loading...'}
  disabled
  helperText="You can only apply leave for yourself"
/>
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Added Current Employee State
```typescript
const [currentEmployee, setCurrentEmployee] = useState<Employee | null>(null);
```

### 2. Created fetchCurrentEmployee() Function
```typescript
const fetchCurrentEmployee = async () => {
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('vtria_token');
    if (!token) {
      console.error('No authentication token found');
      return;
    }

    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'}/api/employees/current`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const result = await response.json();
      if (result.success && result.data) {
        const empData: Employee = {
          id: result.data.id,
          employee_id: result.data.employee_id,
          first_name: result.data.first_name,
          last_name: result.data.last_name
        };
        setCurrentEmployee(empData);
        // Auto-set employee_id in form
        setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, employee_id: empData.id.toString() }));
        console.log('Current employee loaded:', empData);
      }
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to fetch current employee');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching current employee:', error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Updated useEffect to Load Current Employee
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchCurrentEmployee(); // ✅ NEW: Fetch logged-in employee first
  fetchLeaveApplications();
  fetchLeaveTypes();
  fetchEmployees(); // Still needed for filtering applications
}, [statusFilter, employeeFilter]);
```

### 4. Updated resetForm()
```typescript
const resetForm = () => {
  setFormData({
    employee_id: currentEmployee?.id.toString() || '', // ✅ Auto-populate
    leave_type_id: '',
    start_date: '',
    end_date: '',
    // ... rest
  });
};
```

### 5. Updated Form Validation
```typescript
disabled={
  !formData.leave_type_id?.toString().trim() ||
  !formData.start_date?.trim() ||
  !formData.end_date?.trim() ||
  !formData.reason?.trim() ||
  (formData.start_date && formData.end_date && new Date(formData.start_date) > new Date(formData.end_date)) ||
  loading ||
  !currentEmployee // ✅ NEW: Check if employee loaded
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Page Load
```bash
URL: http://localhost/vtria-erp/leave-management
Expected:
- Click "Apply for Leave"
- See YOUR name pre-filled (e.g., "System Administrator (EMP/2025/001)")
- Field is disabled (greyed out)
- Helper text: "You can only apply leave for yourself"
```

### Test 2: Application Submission
```bash
Steps:
1. Click "Apply for Leave"
2. Employee already filled (YOU)
3. Select leave type
4. Select dates
5. Enter reason
6. Submit

Expected:
- Application created for logged-in user
- Appears in table with correct employee name
- No way to change employee
```

### Test 3: Different Users
```bash
Login as: admin@vtria.com → Should see "System Administrator"
Login as: director@vtria.com → Should see "VTRIA Director"  
Login as: manager@vtria.com → Should see "Production Manager"

Each user can ONLY apply leave for themselves
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### For HR/Admin Panel (Separate Section):
If HR needs to apply leave on behalf of employees:
1. Create separate "HR Leave Management" section
2. Add role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Require approval workflow
4. Add audit trail for admin actions

### For Now:
✅ Employees: Self-service leave application  
✅ Managers: Approve/reject applications  
✅ HR: View all applications (filter by employee)
