---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. **Product-Level GST Configuration**
- Each product in inventory now has a `gst_rate` field
- Set GST rates when adding/editing products in inventory
- Supports all GST rates: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%, etc.

### 2. **State-Based Calculation**
- **Home State**: Karnataka (configurable)
- **Intrastate** (within Karnataka): CGST 9% + SGST 9% = 18%
- **Interstate** (outside Karnataka): IGST 18%

### 3. **Automatic Flow**
```
Product GST Rate → Estimation → Quotation → Sales Order → Invoice
```

## 💼 BUSINESS SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Local Customer (Intrastate)
```
Product: ₹10,000 (18% GST)
Customer: Karnataka
Result: CGST ₹900 + SGST ₹900 = ₹1,800 total tax
```

### Scenario 2: Outstation Customer (Interstate)
```
Product: ₹10,000 (18% GST)
Customer: Maharashtra
Result: IGST ₹1,800 total tax
```

### Scenario 3: Different GST Rates
```
Product A: ₹5,000 (5% GST) = ₹250 tax
Product B: ₹5,000 (28% GST) = ₹1,400 tax
Mixed cart total tax varies by product
```
