# Docker Rebuild Status - October 12, 2025

## Current Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

The Docker client container is currently being rebuilt in the background.

**Background Job:** `[1] docker-compose build client`  
**Log File:** `/tmp/docker-build.log`

### What's Happening:
The build process is installing npm dependencies (React, Material-UI, etc.). This takes 5-10 minutes on first build.

---

## Check Build Progress

Run this command to see the current status:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/docker-build.log
```

Or check if the job is still running:
```bash
jobs
```

---

## Once Build Completes

### Step 1: Check if build succeeded
```bash
docker-compose build client
```
You should see "Successfully built" and "Successfully tagged"

### Step 2: Start the containers
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Verify services are running
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 4: Test the application
Open your browser and go to:
- Frontend: `http://localhost/vtria-erp/`
- API: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

---

## Alternative: Quick Development Mode

If the Docker build is taking too long, you can use development mode instead:

### Stop Docker
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Start API Server (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp/api
npm start
```

### Start React Dev Server (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp/client
PORT=3000 npm start
```

### Access the app
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API: `http://localhost:5000`

**Advantage:** No build time, hot reload, faster development  
**Disadvantage:** Not production-ready, requires 2 terminals

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails or takes too long:
```bash
# Kill the background job
jobs  # Note the job number
kill %1  # Replace 1 with your job number

# Clear Docker cache and try again
docker system prune -a -f
docker-compose build client
```

### If you see "port already in use":
```bash
# Stop all Docker containers
docker-compose down

# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :80
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

## Files Modified (Already Applied)

All source code changes have been applied:
- âœ… EmployeeManagement.tsx
- âœ… EmployeeDashboard.tsx  
- âœ… EnterpriseEmployeeManagement.js
- âœ… SalesEnquiry.js

The build process will package these changes into the Docker image.

---

## Expected Timeline

- **npm install**: 5-10 minutes (currently running)
- **npm run build**: 2-3 minutes
- **Docker image creation**: 1-2 minutes
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes

---

## Next Steps After Build

1. âœ… Hard refresh browser (`Cmd + Shift + R`)
2. âœ… Verify no 404/500 errors in console
3. âœ… Test employee pages show same data
4. âœ… Confirm competitive-bidding returns 404
