# 🔧 Purchase Requisition & Open Quotations Synchronization Fix

## **🎯 Issue Identified**

When a Purchase Requisition (PR) is **deleted** from the Purchase Requisition page (`/purchase-requisition`), the associated quotation should reappear in the **"Open Quotations"** tab, but this wasn't happening due to missing data refresh.

## **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

### **Backend Logic (Correct)**
The backend `getOpenQuotationsWithGroupedParts` API correctly filters quotations using this SQL logic:
```sql
LEFT JOIN purchase_requisitions pr ON (pr.quotation_id = q.id OR pr.quotation_id = q.quotation_number)
    AND pr.status IN ('draft', 'pending_approval', 'approved')
WHERE q.status IN ('approved', 'sent')
AND pr.id IS NULL  -- Only show quotations WITHOUT active PRs
```

This means:
- ✅ Quotations **without** active PRs appear in "Open Quotations"
- ✅ When PR is **created** → quotation disappears from "Open Quotations"  
- ✅ When PR is **deleted** → quotation should reappear in "Open Quotations"
- ✅ When PR is **rejected** → quotation should reappear in "Open Quotations"

### **Frontend Issue (Fixed)**
The frontend `handleDelete` function was only refreshing the PR list but not the Open Quotations list:

**Before (Incorrect):**
```javascript
const handleDelete = async (requisition) => {
  // ... delete logic
  fetchRequisitions(); // ✅ Refreshes PR list
  // ❌ Missing: fetchOpenQuotations() refresh
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const handleDelete = async (requisition) => {
  // ... delete logic  
  fetchRequisitions(); // ✅ Refreshes PR list
  await fetchOpenQuotations(); // ✅ Refreshes Open Quotations list
};
```

## **🛠️ Changes Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Delete Function**
**File:** `/client/src/components/PurchaseRequisition.js`

```javascript
const handleDelete = async (requisition) => {
  if (window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete requisition ${requisition.pr_number}?`)) {
    try {
      await axios.delete(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/purchase-requisition/${requisition.id}`);
      fetchRequisitions();
      // ✅ NEW: Refresh open quotations as the deleted PR's quotation should now reappear
      await fetchOpenQuotations();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error deleting requisition:', error);
      setError('Error deleting requisition');
    }
  }
};
```

### **2. Fixed Status Update Function**
Enhanced `handleUpdateStatus` to refresh Open Quotations when PR is rejected:

```javascript
const handleUpdateStatus = async (id, status, reason = null) => {
  try {
    await axios.put(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/purchase-requisition/${id}/status`, {
      status,
      rejection_reason: reason
    });
    fetchRequisitions();
    // ✅ NEW: Refresh open quotations when PR is rejected (makes quotation available again)
    if (status === 'rejected') {
      await fetchOpenQuotations();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating status:', error);
    setError('Error updating requisition status');
  }
};
```

### **3. Added Documentation to Approve Function**
Enhanced `handleApprovePR` with clear documentation:

```javascript
const handleApprovePR = async (prId) => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to approve this purchase requisition?')) {
    try {
      await axios.put(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/purchase-requisition/${prId}/status`, {
        status: 'approved'
      });
      fetchRequisitions();
      // ✅ NOTE: Approved PRs remain linked to quotations, so no need to refresh open quotations
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error approving PR:', error);
      setError('Error approving purchase requisition');
    }
  }
};
```

## **📊 Business Logic Flow**

### **Complete PR Lifecycle & Open Quotations Impact:**

| PR Action | PR Status Change | Open Quotations Impact | Refresh Needed |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Create PR** | `null` → `draft` | Quotation disappears | ✅ Already implemented |
| **Submit PR** | `draft` → `pending_approval` | Remains hidden | ❌ No refresh needed |
| **Approve PR** | `pending_approval` → `approved` | Remains hidden | ❌ No refresh needed |
| **Reject PR** | `pending_approval` → `rejected` | Quotation reappears | ✅ **FIXED** |
| **Delete PR** | Any status → `deleted` | Quotation reappears | ✅ **FIXED** |

## **🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **User Workflow:**
1. **User sees quotation** in "Open Quotations" tab
2. **User creates PR** from quotation → quotation disappears from "Open Quotations" 
3. **User deletes PR** → quotation **reappears** in "Open Quotations" ✅
4. **User rejects PR** → quotation **reappears** in "Open Quotations" ✅

### **Real-Time Synchronization:**
- ✅ **Creation**: Open Quotations immediately updated when PR created
- ✅ **Deletion**: Open Quotations immediately updated when PR deleted  
- ✅ **Rejection**: Open Quotations immediately updated when PR rejected
- ✅ **Approval**: No change needed (quotation stays linked to approved PR)

## **🔄 Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Delete PR**
1. Navigate to `/purchase-requisition`
2. Create a PR from an open quotation
3. Verify quotation disappears from "Open Quotations" tab
4. Delete the PR
5. **Expected**: Quotation immediately reappears in "Open Quotations" tab ✅

### **Test Case 2: Reject PR** 
1. Create PR and submit for approval (`pending_approval` status)
2. Reject the PR with a reason
3. **Expected**: Quotation immediately reappears in "Open Quotations" tab ✅

### **Test Case 3: Approve PR**
1. Create PR and submit for approval  
2. Approve the PR
3. **Expected**: Quotation remains hidden (correct behavior) ✅

## **🏆 Benefits Achieved**
