# ✅ Leave Management Self-Service - Complete

**Issue Reported**: Employee dropdown blank in "Apply for Leave"  
**Root Cause**: Wrong design - shouldn't show all employees  
**Solution**: Self-service model - employees apply leave for themselves only  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Wrong Design):
- 🔴 Dropdown showing all employees
- 🔴 Users could apply leave for anyone
- 🔴 API fetch failing (causing blank dropdown)
- 🔴 Security risk
- 🔴 Confusing UX

### After (Correct Design):
- ✅ Pre-filled with logged-in user only
- ✅ Disabled field (can't change)
- ✅ Helper text: "You can only apply leave for yourself"
- ✅ Uses `/api/employees/current` endpoint
- ✅ Secure self-service model

## 📝 Technical Summary

### Changes Made to LeaveManagement.tsx:

1. **Added State**:
   ```typescript
   const [currentEmployee, setCurrentEmployee] = useState<Employee | null>(null);
   ```

2. **Added Function**:
   ```typescript
   const fetchCurrentEmployee = async () => {
     // Fetches logged-in user from /api/employees/current
     // Auto-populates formData.employee_id
   }
   ```

3. **Updated UI**:
   ```typescript
   // FROM: Dropdown with all employees
   <Select value={formData.employee_id} ...>
     {employees.map(emp => <MenuItem>...)}
   </Select>
   
   // TO: Disabled field with current user
   <TextField
     value="John Doe (EMP/2025/001)"
     disabled
     helperText="You can only apply leave for yourself"
   />
   ```

4. **Updated Validation**:
   - Removed: Check if employee selected
   - Added: Check if currentEmployee loaded
   - Removed: "Please select an employee" message

## 💡 Future: HR Leave Management

If HR/Admin needs to apply leave for employees:

### Create Separate Section:
- Path: `/vtria-erp/hr/leave-management`
- Role: HR_ADMIN only
- Features:
  - Employee dropdown (all employees)
  - Approval workflow
  - Audit trail
  - Bulk operations

### Keep Current Section:
- Path: `/vtria-erp/leave-management`
- Role: All employees
- Feature: Self-service only

**Status**: 🟢 **FIXED - AWAITING CLIENT REBUILD**

You were absolutely right! The system now properly implements self-service leave application where employees can only apply leave for themselves. This is the correct design for employee self-service portals.
