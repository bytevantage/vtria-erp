# üö® URGENT: Employee Data Issues - QUICK FIX

**Problem Summary:**
1. ‚úÖ Employee Dashboard shows 3 FAKE employees ("John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Mike Johnson") - **HARDCODED MOCK DATA**
2. ‚úÖ Employee Management shows 0 employees - **REAL DATA (empty employees table)**
3. ‚úÖ You're logged in via `users` table (3 users exist) - **SEPARATE FROM employees**
4. ‚úÖ System is in **PRODUCTION MODE** - **DANGEROUS for development**

---

## ‚úÖ FIXED NOW

### 1. Changed to Development Mode ‚úÖ
**File:** `api/.env` - Line 3
```diff
- NODE_ENV=production
+ NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## üîß STILL NEED TO FIX

### Issue: Two Separate Tables

Your system has:
- **`users` table** = 3 users (for login) ‚Üê This is why you can log in
- **`employees` table** = 0 employees (for HR management) ‚Üê Empty!

### Issue: Fake Data in Dashboard

**File:** `client/src/components/EmployeeDashboard.tsx` (Lines 79-101)

The dashboard shows **HARDCODED** fake data:
```typescript
const [recentActivities] = useState<RecentActivity[]>([
  {
    employee_name: 'John Doe'     // ‚Üê FAKE!
  },
  {
    employee_name: 'Jane Smith'   // ‚Üê FAKE!
  },
  {
    employee_name: 'Mike Johnson' // ‚Üê FAKE!
  }
]);
```

## üöÄ Quick Solution: Sync Users to Employees

Run this SQL to create employees from your users:

```bash
# Connect to database
docker exec -it vtria-erp-db-1 mysql -u vtria_user -p
# Password: dev_password

USE vtria_erp;

# Create employees from users
INSERT INTO employees (
  first_name, 
  last_name, 
  email, 
  hire_date, 
  status,
  employee_type,
  created_at
)
SELECT 
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(full_name, ' ', 1) as first_name,
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(full_name, ' ', -1) as last_name,
  email,
  created_at as hire_date,
  CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 'active' ELSE 'inactive' END as status,
  'full_time' as employee_type,
  NOW()
FROM users
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE employees.email = users.email
);

# Generate employee IDs
UPDATE employees 
SET employee_id = CONCAT('EMP', LPAD(id, 4, '0'))
WHERE employee_id IS NULL OR employee_id = '';

# Check results
SELECT id, employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, status FROM employees;

exit;
```

---

## üîÑ Restart Everything

```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp

# Restart
docker-compose restart

# Check logs
docker-compose logs api | grep "Environment:"
# Should show: Environment: development
```

---

## ‚úÖ After Fix You'll See:

1. **Employee Dashboard:** Shows 3 REAL employees (from employees table)
2. **Employee Management:** Shows 3 REAL employees (same data)
3. **Users:** Shows 3 users (unchanged)
4. **Environment:** development mode ‚úÖ

---

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Production mode fixed ‚Üí development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still need to run SQL to sync users ‚Üí employees
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still need to remove hardcoded mock data (optional, will show real data once employees exist)

**Next:** Run the SQL commands above to populate employees table.
