## 🎓 Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Why total_amount instead of amount in P&L?
**Decision:** Use `total_amount` (amount + tax)  
**Reason:** P&L should reflect total expense including taxes  
**Impact:** More accurate expense reporting

### 2. Why approval_status = 'approved' filter?
**Decision:** Only include approved expenses in P&L  
**Reason:** Draft/pending expenses shouldn't affect financial statements  
**Impact:** Prevents inflated expense figures

### 3. Why soft delete instead of hard delete?
**Decision:** Set `is_active = FALSE` instead of DELETE  
**Reason:** Maintain audit trail and compliance  
**Impact:** Can recover deleted expenses, maintain history

### 4. Why transaction-safe operations?
**Decision:** Use START TRANSACTION / COMMIT / ROLLBACK  
**Reason:** Prevent data corruption on failures  
**Impact:** Data integrity guaranteed

### 5. Why separate items table?
**Decision:** Created `expense_items` table  
**Reason:** Support detailed line-item breakdown  
**Impact:** Better expense analysis and reporting
