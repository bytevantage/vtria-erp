# VTRIA ERP: Advanced Inventory & Stock Management Features

## Overview

This document details the advanced inventory management features implemented for VTRIA ERP, addressing complex scenarios like multi-price batches, serial number allocation during estimation, and comprehensive stock tracking.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Features Implemented

### 1. Inline Client Creation in Sales Enquiry ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:** Users needed to create new clients without leaving the sales enquiry form.

**Solution:**
- **InlineClientCreation.tsx** - Modal dialog for quick client creation
- **EnhancedSalesEnquiry.tsx** - Sales enquiry with integrated client management
- Real-time validation and GSTIN format checking
- Automatic client list refresh after creation

**Key Features:**
- Autocomplete client selection with search
- "Add New Client" button in dropdown
- Complete client form with validation
- Immediate availability in parent form

### 2. Multi-Price Inventory Batch Management ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:** Same product received at different prices on different dates needed proper cost tracking.

**Solution:**
- **Inventory Batches System** - Tracks each receipt with specific pricing
- **Multiple Costing Methods** - FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average, Standard Cost
- **Automatic Allocation** - Smart allocation based on costing strategy

#### Database Schema:
```sql
-- inventory_batches: Each purchase lot with specific price
-- inventory_allocations: Tracks which batch items go to which orders
-- inventory_reservations: Temporary holds during estimation
-- inventory_costing_config: Configurable costing methods per location
```

#### Example Scenario:
```
Product: Schneider Contactor LC1D18M7
- Batch 1: Jan 15 - 10 units @ ‚Çπ2,000 each
- Batch 2: Feb 20 - 15 units @ ‚Çπ2,200 each  
- Batch 3: Mar 10 - 8 units @ ‚Çπ1,950 each

FIFO Cost: ‚Çπ2,000 (oldest batch first)
LIFO Cost: ‚Çπ1,950 (newest batch first)
Average Cost: ‚Çπ2,076 (weighted average)
```

### 3. Serial Number Allocation During Estimation ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:** Designers needed to allocate specific serial numbers during estimation phase based on performance requirements.

**Solution:**
- **Serial Number Selector Component** - Advanced selection interface
- **Performance-Based Selection** - Recommendations based on history
- **Warranty Tracking** - Individual warranty dates per serial
- **Technical Specifications** - Reason tracking for allocations

#### Key Features:
- **Smart Recommendations**: Based on performance rating, failure history
- **Warranty Management**: Track individual warranty periods
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Automated scoring for best matches
- **Allocation Reasons**: Track why specific serials were chosen

#### Example Use Case:
```
Estimation for Critical Motor Application:
- Product: High-Performance Motor
- Required: 2 units
- Allocation Criteria: 
  * Performance Rating: Excellent
  * Warranty: Minimum 2 years remaining
  * Zero failure history
  * Client specification compliance

System recommends:
- Serial #M123456: Excellent rating, 3yr warranty, 0 failures
- Serial #M789012: Excellent rating, 2.5yr warranty, 0 failures
```

### 4. Price-Serial Number Relationship System ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:** Track cost per individual serial number for accurate project costing.

**Solution:**
- **Batch-Serial Linking** - Each serial linked to purchase batch with specific cost
- **Cost Inheritance** - Serials inherit cost from their purchase batch
- **Dynamic Pricing** - Real-time cost calculation based on selected serials

#### Database Design:
```sql
-- Links serial numbers to purchase batches
serial_number -> inventory_batch -> purchase_price

-- Estimation allocations track specific costs
estimation_serial_allocations (
    serial_number_id,
    unit_cost,  -- From the batch this serial came from
    allocation_reason
)
```

### 5. Advanced Stock Movement Tracking ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:** Complete audit trail of all inventory movements with proper costing.

**Features:**
- **Movement Types**: Inward, Outward, Transfer, Adjustment, Damage, Return
- **Reference Tracking**: Link to purchase orders, sales orders, manufacturing orders
- **Automatic Triggers**: Update stock levels automatically
- **Cost Tracking**: Track unit cost per movement

## üîÑ Business Process Flow

### 1. Sales Enquiry with New Client
```
1. User starts new sales enquiry
2. If client not in dropdown ‚Üí Click "Add New Client"
3. Modal opens with client form
4. User fills company details, validation occurs
5. Client created and immediately available
6. Sales enquiry completed with new client selected
```

### 2. Estimation with Specific Serial Allocation
```
1. Designer creates estimation
2. For critical products ‚Üí Select "Specific Serial" allocation
3. SerialNumberSelector opens showing:
   - Available serials with performance data
   - Warranty status and expiry dates
   - Compatibility scores
   - Cost per serial from batch
4. Designer selects best serials based on requirements
5. System calculates exact cost using selected serials
6. Estimation shows accurate pricing with serial details
```

### 3. Multi-Price Inventory Management
```
1. Product received at different prices:
   - Batch A: 10 units @ ‚Çπ100 each (Jan 1)
   - Batch B: 15 units @ ‚Çπ120 each (Feb 1)
   - Batch C: 8 units @ ‚Çπ95 each (Mar 1)

2. During estimation:
   - FIFO method: Uses Batch A first (‚Çπ100)
   - LIFO method: Uses Batch C first (‚Çπ95)
   - Average method: Uses weighted average (‚Çπ108.5)
