## Issues Found and Resolved

### Issue #1: Authentication Role Mismatch
**Problem:** Payroll routes required 'hr' and 'finance' roles, but database only has 'admin', 'director', 'accounts' roles.
**Solution:** Updated all payroll routes to use actual system roles (admin, director, accounts, sales-admin).
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Transaction Commands in Prepared Statements
**Problem:** `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` commands failed when using `db.execute()`.
**Solution:** Changed transaction commands to use `db.query()` instead of `db.execute()`.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #3: Context Loss in Helper Functions
**Problem:** `this.getDaysBetween()` returned "Cannot read properties of undefined".
**Solution:** Moved helper functions (getDaysBetween, calculatePF, calculateESI, calculatePT) outside the class as standalone functions.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #4: LIMIT Parameter in Prepared Statements
**Problem:** MySQL2 `execute()` doesn't handle LIMIT/OFFSET parameters correctly.
**Solution:** Changed affected queries to use `db.query()` with inline LIMIT values.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Statutory Compliance Verification

### Provident Fund (PF)
- ✅ Ceiling applied correctly (max Rs. 15,000)
- ✅ Employee contribution: 12%
- ✅ Employer contribution: 12%

### Employee State Insurance (ESI)
- ✅ Threshold check (gross ≤ Rs. 21,000)
- ✅ Not applicable for test employee (gross = Rs. 52,850)
- ✅ Would calculate 0.75% if applicable

### Professional Tax (PT)
- ✅ Slab-based calculation (Karnataka)
- ✅ Correct amount for Rs. 52,850 gross: Rs. 208.33

### Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)
- ✅ Calculation based on annual income
- ✅ Standard deduction applied
- ✅ Ready for 80C/80D declarations
