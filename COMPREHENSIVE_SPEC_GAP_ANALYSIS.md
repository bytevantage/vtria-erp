### Priority Matrix

| Feature | Implementation % | Priority | Effort |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------|
| Ticketing System | 0% | CRITICAL | High |
| Queue Workflow | 30% | CRITICAL | Medium |
| Case Aging | 0% | HIGH | Low |
| Warranty Automation | 40% | HIGH | Medium |
| Multi-Role Users | 0% | HIGH | Medium |
| Case Closure | 20% | HIGH | Low |
| Manufacturing Queue | 30% | MEDIUM | Medium |

### Estimated Timeline

**Phase 1 (2-3 weeks):** Critical features - Ticketing, Queues, Aging  
**Phase 2 (2-3 weeks):** High priority - Warranties, Roles, Closure  
**Phase 3 (3-4 weeks):** Medium priority - Manufacturing, Docs, Reports  
**Phase 4 (2 weeks):** Testing, refinement, deployment

**Total Estimated Effort:** 9-12 weeks to full specification compliance
