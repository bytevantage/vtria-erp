# Issue Fixes - October 12, 2025

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ Competitive Bidding Page Still Accessible
**Problem:** The `/competitive-bidding` route was still accessible even though it was removed from the sidebar and commented out in the code.

**Root Cause:** The React production build directory (`client/build/`) contained cached files with the old code that still had the competitive bidding feature.

**Solution:**
- Deleted the entire `client/build/` directory
- The route is already commented out in `App.js` (lines 352-359)
- The sidebar doesn't have competitive bidding menu item

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Build cache cleared. Browser hard refresh needed.

### 2. ✅ Employee Data Mismatch Between Pages
**Problem:** 
- Employee Dashboard (`/employee-dashboard`) showed 3 employees
- Employee Management (`/employee-management`) showed 0 employees

**Root Cause:** The two pages were using different API endpoints:
- **Employee Dashboard** → `/api/employees/dashboard/data` (uses `employees` table)
- **Employee Management** → `/api/users/with-hr` (uses `users` table with `hr_employee_id`)

The `users` table had no records with `hr_employee_id` populated, while the `employees` table had 3 records.

**Solution:**
Updated multiple components to use the consistent employee API:
- ✅ `EmployeeManagement.tsx` - Changed to `/api/employees`
- ✅ `EmployeeDashboard.tsx` - Fixed token and recent activities endpoint
- ✅ `EnterpriseEmployeeManagement.js` - Changed to `/api/employees`
- ✅ `SalesEnquiry.js` - Changed user fetch to `/api/employees`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - All components now use `/api/employees` endpoint.

---

### 3. ✅ Authentication Token Inconsistency
**Problem:** 
- 401 Unauthorized errors on employee pages
- Mixed usage of `authToken` vs `vtria_token`

**Root Cause:** Some components were using `localStorage.getItem('authToken')` while the AuthContext stores the token as `vtria_token`.

**Solution:**
- Verified that AuthContext uses `vtria_token`
- Updated `EmployeeDashboard.tsx` to use `vtria_token`
- `EmployeeManagement.tsx` already uses `vtria_token`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Token consistency maintained.

## API Endpoint Mapping (Standardized)

### Employee Management:
- `GET /api/employees` - Fetch employees with pagination
- `GET /api/employees/:id` - Get single employee
- `POST /api/employees` - Create new employee
- `PUT /api/employees/:id` - Update employee
- `DELETE /api/employees/:id` - Delete employee

### Employee Dashboard:
- `GET /api/employees/dashboard/data` - Dashboard statistics

### Master Data:
- `GET /api/employees/master/departments` - Fetch departments
- `POST /api/employees/master/departments` - Create new department
- `GET /api/employees/master/leave-types` - Fetch leave types
- `GET /api/employees/master/locations` - Fetch work locations

## Testing Steps

### For Competitive Bidding Issue:
1. ✅ Clear browser cache (Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
2. ✅ Try navigating to `http://localhost/vtria-erp/competitive-bidding`
3. ✅ You should get a 404 or "Page Not Found" error
4. ✅ Verify the sidebar doesn't show "Competitive Bidding" menu item

### For Employee Management Issue:
1. ✅ Hard refresh browser (Cmd + Shift + R)
2. ✅ Navigate to `http://localhost/vtria-erp/employee-dashboard`
3. ✅ Note the number of employees shown (should be 3)
4. ✅ Navigate to `http://localhost/vtria-erp/employee-management`
5. ✅ Verify the same 3 employees are shown
6. ✅ Check browser console - no 404 or 500 errors

### For Authentication:
1. ✅ Verify login works correctly
2. ✅ Check that `vtria_token` is stored in localStorage
3. ✅ No 401 Unauthorized errors on employee pages

## Database Tables Reference:
- **employees** - Main employee records (3 records exist) ✅ **PRIMARY SOURCE**
- **users** - System users (authentication only)
- **departments** - Department master data
