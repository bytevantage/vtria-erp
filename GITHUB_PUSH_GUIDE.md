## 🚀 **Step 3: Push Your Code**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Or use these:

```bash
# Your code is already committed, just push it
git push -u origin develop

# Create and push production branch  
git checkout -b production
git push -u origin production

# Create and push main branch for releases
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you might need a Personal Access Token.

## 🔐 **Step 4: Authentication (If Needed)**

If you get "Authentication failed" error:

### Option A: Use GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. Download **GitHub Desktop** (free): https://desktop.github.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Clone your repository through the app

### Option B: Personal Access Token
1. **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**
2. **Generate new token** with "repo" permissions
3. **Use token as password** when prompted

### Option C: SSH Key (Advanced)
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys
```

## 🎯 **Alternative: Use Our Package Method**

If GitHub seems complicated right now, you can deploy immediately:

```bash
# Create deployment package (no GitHub needed)
./create-deployment-package.sh

# Transfer to Windows and deploy
# Follow package instructions
```

You can always set up GitHub later!
