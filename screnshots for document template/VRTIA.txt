I am developing a software for VTRIA Engineering Solutions Pvt Ltd in Mangalore, Karnataka, India.
They have multiple offices in Karnataka, 2 in Mangalore , 1 in Bangalore and 1 in Pune Maharastra.
They keep stocks at all three locations.
Their scope of work is Industrial Automation, Electrical Control Panels, Industrial Air Conditioning - HVAC, Industrial Refrigeration and now into manufacture of Very large Ceiling fans for large halls.

The case history and status should be shown at the bottom of the page as a small horizontal flow chart to track the progress.
Every task should be tracked.

The typical business flow will be as follows;

All generated reports will be in the following format.
VESPL/XX/2526/XXX
EQ - Enquiry
ET - Estimation
Q - Quotation
SO - Sales Order
GRN - Goods Received Note
I - Invoice
PO - Purchase Order
PI - Proforma Invoice
DC - Delivery Challan
BOM - Bill of Material

XX is the appropriate code such as EQ,ET etc.
2526 is the financial year. Next year it will be 2627.
XXX is a serial number in ascending order with a default of three numbers starting from 001
The all generated pdf's will have the company header, logo, address, date, place etc.

There are different type of user groups like Director, Admin, Sales-Admin, Designer, Accounts, Technicians.
The user groups will have different privileges on the different pages in this app.

For Sales,
There would be a sales enquiry form with a enquiry ID as 'VESPL/EQ/2526/XXX' , Date, Client (If not in dropdown, add client), Project name, Description, name of the person who got the enquiry, Status by default as new.

This will then be assigned to the designer team where a person will pick it and work on the case.

Product will have a Name, Make, Model, Product Code, Category, Subcategory, Unit (Kgs, Liters, Numbers), MRP, Vendor Dicount, HSN Code, GST Rate, Last Purchase Price, Serial number , Warranty Upto. Warranty Period (Months or Years).
These will have to be tracked for Estimation, Stock Maintenance, Ordering of shortfall, etc.

He will estimate the parts needed for this solution and will have an ID as VESPL/ES/2526/XXX.
On the estimation page, There would be main sections with quantity to be mentioned, which will have editable headings which VTRIA will change to 'Main Panel', 'Generator', 'UPS', 'Incoming', 'Outgoing' etc. Under the section he will add subsections. The subsections heading will be edited like 'Incoming', 'outgoing' etc by VTRIA. There may be as many sub sections needed.  Under the subsections, he will add the Materials needed for this section like able to add items and quantities as follows, Name, Make, Model, Part Code, Category, Sub Category, Quantity, MRP, Last price revision date, Last Price, Discount in percentage, Discounted Price, Final Price. VTRIA may add multiple sub sections. The designer will just chose the  Name, Make, Model, Part Code, Category, Sub Category. Quantity will be a manual entry. Rest of the tings will be retrieved from the product and other tables from the database. Have a small highlight under the quantity if its not available in stocks. The designer should be able to modify the discount applied.
The estimation will have a total price of MRP, total final price, aggregate of the discount applied.
This estimation will be assigned to the Admin-Sales group for approval. and downloaded for self reference.
I will receive the same products from the same vendor on different days which will have different price and discounts. This software should handle it well by bringing the best of the item during estimation.

The case is then moved to the Admin - Sales for quotation generation with id 'VESPL/Q/2526/XXX'. This will again pushed to the approver 'Director' and once approved, it can be downloaded to be sent to the customer by the admin-sales.
the quote will have a different format to display the items. 
We wont give the parts by parts list, we will only show items as below
Headings, address and other details on top.
Item list.
No, Image if available, Item(this will be the Main category heading during estimation) with description, HSN/SAC, Qty, Unit, Rate, Discount given, Tax, CGST, SGST, or IGST only if other state, Amount, Lead time for delivery. Before the PDF is generated, the page should show the profit percentage on this quote and highlight with an alert if below 10%.
With this quote a separate bill of Material (BOM) 'VESPL/BOM/2526/XXX' should be displayed and generated as a pdf.

Once approved, by the customer, a purchase enquiry is created with the ID as 'VESPL/PR/2526/XXX' to the supplier of parts to VTRIA for the availability and price. It could be edited if needed. This enquiry is a PDF that will be sent by regular mail. 

Once VTRIA received the response from the supplier, a PO 'VESPL/PO/2526/XXX' is created with the price from the supplier. At this point the page should display the price difference in the estimate and the current price from the supplier for a reference on the page. Once this is approved by the Admin-sales the download button will be enabled for sending it to the supplier as a Proforma invoice 'VESPL/PI/2526/XXX' . The payment will be done via PDC or Online to the account number mentioned in the Supplier data.
The Supplier then will dispatch the materials with a LR number and the purchase invoice. Once received VTRIA will generate the GRN( Goods Received note pdf) 'VESPL/GRN/2526/XXX' and download it. The materials will be verified against the PO. A page will open with this list where we can update the Serial number against the materials with the warranty expiry date. Then we should be able to push it into stocks into the stores. We should be able to move it as a bulk movement to a store or split it into multiple available stores.
We need a provision to move the items between stores as well.

Then the case is moved to Manufacturing phase.
On the manufactruing phase, the case will be taken over by a technician.
The case will show the technicians name as the case owner with the accepted date on top with the status of the production also displayed.
The case will display all technical info needed for manufacture.
We should be able to upload technical documents on this page that can be downloaded as when needed.
We track usage of materials in the job by adding then as required from the BOM of this order. Any shortfall will need approval. Any excess will be returned to stocks with proper track.
Once this is complete we will move it to the Dispatch store for delivery to the customer.
A invoice is created with id 'VESPL/I/2526/XXX'. A delivery challan is also created with id 'VESPL/DC/2526/XXX'. All these documents will be downloaded to predefined folders that can be modified under settings as needed.
The database is within the docker.

Dont work on authentication now. It will be the last task as i don't want a login page every time during development phase.
The remaining of the tasks will be given later as we will start with this now and get it ready bug free.



I will receive the same products from the same vendor on different days which will have different price and discounts. This software should handle it well by bringing the best of the item during estimation.





 üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary:

  PRODUCT MASTER (Static/Reference Data):
  - Product specifications, pricing, warranty templates
  - Categories, manufacturers, units of measurement
  - HSN codes, GST rates, vendor discount percentages
  - Reorder points and stock thresholds

  INVENTORY (Dynamic/Transactional Data):
  - Location-specific stock quantities (available/reserved/damaged)
  - Serial number tracking with individual warranty dates
  - Stock movements and cost tracking
  - Multiple valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, Average)
