# 🚨 URGENT: Competitive Bidding Fix Required

**Issue:** Users get logged out when selecting winning bid  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocks competitive bidding feature  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to deploy

---

## 🔴 Two Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Wrong API Endpoint (Frontend)
- **File:** `client/src/components/CompetitiveBiddingManager.jsx` Line 176
- **Problem:** Called `/api/purchase-requisition/from-rfq-winner` (doesn't exist)
- **Fixed:** Changed to `/api/rfq-campaigns/from-rfq-winner`

### Bug #2: Database Type Mismatch (Backend) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **File:** `api/src/controllers/rfq.controller.js` Lines 238, 259
- **Problem:** Used `quotation_number` (string "QT-2024-001") instead of `quotation_id` (integer 123)
- **Impact:** Database rejected insert → 500 error → User logged out
- **Fixed:** Changed to use `quotation_id` (numeric)

---

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions

### Backend (API) - MUST RESTART
```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp

# If using Docker:
docker-compose restart api

# If running locally:
cd api
# Kill the running process and restart
npm start
```

### Frontend (Client) - MUST REBUILD
```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp/client

# Development:
npm start

# Production:
npm run build
```

### If using Docker (Full Stack):
```bash
cd /Users/srbhandary/Documents/Projects/vtria-erp
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
