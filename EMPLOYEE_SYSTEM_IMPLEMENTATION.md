# Employee Management System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Problem Resolved

**Issue**: The Employee Management page at `http://localhost:3000/vtria-erp/employee-management` was showing blank content with non-functional buttons and hardcoded demo data instead of connecting to the database.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Employee management routes were commented out in App.js
2. API endpoints existed but were not integrated in the main server
3. Database tables existed but were empty
4. Frontend was using hardcoded demo data instead of API calls

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### 1. **Frontend Integration**
- âœ… Uncommented employee management routes in `App.js`
- âœ… Enabled all employee component imports
- âœ… Created new `EmployeeManagementMain.tsx` component as main hub
- âœ… Replaced hardcoded data with real API integration
- âœ… Added proper error handling and loading states
- âœ… Implemented real-time data fetching from backend

### 2. **Backend Integration**
- âœ… Added employee routes to main server (`server.js`)
- âœ… Integrated `employee.routes.js` with API endpoints
- âœ… Verified employee controller with dashboard data endpoint
- âœ… Established proper database connection and queries

### 3. **Database Setup**
- âœ… Verified employee management schema exists
- âœ… Created missing tables: `attendance_records`, `leave_applications`
- âœ… Populated database with 20 sample employees across 5 departments
- âœ… Added realistic attendance data for current date
- âœ… Inserted sample leave applications for demonstration

### 4. **Data Structure**
```sql
