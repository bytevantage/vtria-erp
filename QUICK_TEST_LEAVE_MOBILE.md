## üéØ Test 2: Mobile Attendance (3 minutes)

### URL: http://localhost/vtria-erp/mobile-attendance

### Quick Checks:
1. **Page loads with employee data** ‚úì
   - Should show real employee name (NOT "Demo User")
   - Employee ID displays
   - Department shows

   - Location info displays:
     - Coordinates
     - Accuracy (¬±Xm)
     - Distance from office
     - Status badge (within/outside geofence)

3. **Test geofence (if outside office)** ‚úì
   - If "Outside work location" shows:
   - Check-in button should be DISABLED
   - Error message: "You must be within a designated work location..."

4. **Mock location for testing** ‚úì
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Paste this code to mock within-geofence location:
   ```javascript
   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition = function(success) {
     success({
       coords: {
         latitude: 12.9141,
         longitude: 74.8560,
         accuracy: 10
       }
     });
   };

   - Click "Get Current Location" again
   - Should show "Within work location"
   - Check-in button ENABLED

5. **Check-in** ‚úì
   - Click check-in button
   - Should see success
   - Time displays
   - Late status shows if after 9:15 AM

### Success Criteria:
‚úÖ Employee data loads from API  
‚úÖ GPS location works  
‚úÖ Geofence validation enforced  
‚úÖ Check-in/check-out buttons work  

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Employee Dropdown is Empty (Leave Management):
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.getItem('vtria_token')
```
- If returns `null`: Re-login required
- If returns token: Check API logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs api --tail 50 | grep "employees"
  ```

### If Employee Shows "Demo User" (Mobile Attendance):
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify logged in
3. Test endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   # Get token from localStorage first
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/employees/current
   ```

### If Geofence Always Shows "Outside":
- Hardcoded locations in code:
  - Head Office: 12.9141, 74.8560 (100m radius)
  - Branch Office: 12.9160, 74.8570 (50m radius)
- To test: Use mock location code above

### API Errors:
```bash
# Check API logs
docker-compose logs api --tail 100

# Check for authentication errors
docker-compose logs api | grep "ERROR"

# Restart API if needed
docker-compose restart api
```

## üìä Expected Console Messages

### Leave Management Console:
```
Employees fetched successfully: 3
```

### Mobile Attendance Console:
```
Employee data loaded: {id: 1, name: "...", employee_id: "..."}
Location acquired: {latitude: ..., longitude: ..., accuracy: ...}
Within geofence: true
Attendance recorded successfully
```

### API Logs (Good):
```
api-1  | INFO: GET /api/employees?status=active - 200 OK
api-1  | INFO: GET /api/employees/current - 200 OK
api-1  | INFO: POST /api/enhanced-attendance/record - 200 OK
```
